Magic: The Gathering is a card game developed by Wizards of The Coast, with thousands of cards with unique abilities, strengths, and arts. In this project, I am using neural networks to predict one of the cards attributes (type) from its art. The type attribute of cards can be any of creature, land, artifact, enchantment, instant, sorcery, or planeswalker, and I am going to be mainly trying to predict whether the card will be of creature type.

currently unfinished, succesfully created a binary classification neural network but attempting to create multiclass classification for this effect
